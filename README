README: xrlist (libxrlist) Ian Norton - 2009-02-28 <inorton//gmail.com>

xrlist is a basic C implementation of a linked list/array system. It requires
no external headers or libraries.

The current build system is scons but a Makefile would be trivial, eg:

xrlist.o: xrlist.c xrlist.h
  $(CC) -c xrlist.c 

Have fun :)

Ian
